SMART RESTAURANT BOT

IN THIS PROJECT I HAVE USED WATSON ASSISTANT, TEXT TO SPEECH, CLOUDANT DB FOR STORING CUSTOMER DETAILS OF ORDER AND NODE-RED APPLICATION AS UI

THIS BOT WILL ASK THE CUSTOMERS FOR THEIR BASIC DETAILS LIKE NAME, EMAIL ID, AND PHONE NUMBER AND IT HAS ALSO CAPABLITIES TO SHOW THE MENU AND ASLO CAN DISPLAY THE OFFERS OF THE DAY

IT CAN ALSO TAKE THE ORDERS OF CUSTOMER AND PING THEM WHEN ORDER WILL BE READY

IT WILL STORE ALL THE DETAILS ASKED IN THE BOT INTO THE CLOUDANT DATABASE SO THAT IT CAN PROVIDE CUSTOMER FEEDBACK ALSO THE DATABASE CAN U FETCHED BY THE RESTAURANT FOR MAKING THE ORDER AND ONCE THE RESTAURANT CHECKS THAT ORDER IS COMPLETE
AUTOMATICALLLY, THE CUSTOMER WILL KNOW THAT ORDER IS READY.
